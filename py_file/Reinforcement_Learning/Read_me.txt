In this folder are using different reinforcement learning method training a agent to deal with the same problem.

The problem:  Given a initial number, Score, and a number, N default to be 2. 
              Within the finite steps, in every step agent have to choose a calculate operator(+, -, *, /) in 
              order to maximize the Score.
